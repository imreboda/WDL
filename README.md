World Data League is "a quest to find the worldâ€™s best data scientists to solve social-oriented problems". Teams from all over the world compete in 4 qualification rounds, in each round solving one particular real-life challenge related to data-driven-cities.  

This is the task and my submission* in the third round, which earned top score (in a draw with another team) in this round.

* It is almost the same that I submitted, but not exactly: the code provided here is completed with some extra parts that are marked in the notebook.
